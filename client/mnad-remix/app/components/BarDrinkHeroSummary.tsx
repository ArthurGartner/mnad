        The Moscow Mule is a popular cocktail that originated in the United
        States in the 1940s. It's known for its distinctive serving presentation
        in a copper mug and its simple yet refreshing composition. The drink is
        a mix of vodka, spicy ginger beer, and lime juice, garnished with a
        slice or wedge of lime. This combination creates a perfectly balanced
        blend of sweet, spicy, and citrus flavors, making it a favorite in bars
        and a classic choice for social gatherings. The copper mug in which it
        is traditionally served not only adds a unique aesthetic appeal but also
        enhances the drink's cold temperature, contributing to its crisp and
        invigorating taste.
